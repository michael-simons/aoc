The task was not really hard, and the regular expression is also straight forward.
It becomes interesting when you want to

* read the input only once
* iterate all the matches only once
* and get both solutions in one goâ€¦

I solved this with

* Using a `BufferedReader` and streaming the lines
* flat-mapping them using `java.util.regex.Matcher#results` (returning a stream of `MatchResults`), available since *Java 9*
* Trying out https://openjdk.org/jeps/473[JEP 473: "Stream Gatherers"], will be available from *Java 24*
* Teeing the result, available since *Java 12*

Stream Gatherers are stateful, intermediate stream operations, carrying a state, which I use to stare skipping the next elements or not

To round this up, I also make use of https://openjdk.org/jeps/477[JEP 477: "Implicitly Declared Classes and Instance Main Methods"], allowing me to condense the usual main-class-dance into a single, parameterless function.
Also spot the lack of imports: Implicitly declared classes automatically import, on demand, all the public top-level classes and interfaces of the packages exported by the `java.base` module.

Run with:

[source,bash]

NOTE: Tested with `openjdk version "23.0.1" 2024-10-15`
      Correct solutions are: `178538786` and `102467299`.
