:tags: SQL, DuckDB

Recursive SQL, because why notâ€¦ Albeit, it's a bit slow, but it works well enough.
Part 1 is blazing fast, though.

Run with:

[source,bash]
----
duckdb -c ".read solution.sql" < input.txt
----

NOTE: Tested with DuckDB `v0.9.2 3c695d7ba9`
      Correct solutions are: `25651` and `19499881`.
