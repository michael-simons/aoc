:tags: SQL, DuckDB

== https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/6[Wait For It]

Today I wrote a lot of prose in the code to explain it a bit more. Showcases DuckDB's list comprehension, list arithmetics and the `PIVOT` statement.
Run with:

[source,bash]
----
duckdb -c ".read solution.sql" < input.txt
----

NOTE: Tested with DuckDB `v0.9.2 3c695d7ba9`
      Correct solutions are: `5133600` and `40651271`.
