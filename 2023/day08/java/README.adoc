Tried to wait out to find the solution for part 2, observed that the paths were going in circles, used my brain and implemented a prime factorization based on `BigIntegers` to compute the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple[Lcm] based on the primes of the highest order. Applied https://openjdk.org/jeps/453[Structured Concurrency] again because it's nice.
