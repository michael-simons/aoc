Today using JEP 453 https://openjdk.org/jeps/453[Structured Concurrency] because my initial approach was so dead slow and I actually wanted to use the `StructuredTaskScope` for a while. Kept it that way, but eventually used a binary search per range to find the minimum location. Also applying JEP 445 again, https://openjdk.org/jeps/445[Unnamed Classes and Instance Main Methods] again.
Both JEPS are in preview, so run like this:

[source,bash]

java --enable-preview --source 21 solution.java < input.txt

NOTE: Tested with `openjdk version "21" 2023-09-19`
      Correct solutions are: `265018614` and `63179500`.
